## Prologue

**Expect a lot of Python**

> \[...\] become more demanding of Python. Pretend that Python is a magic wand that will miraculously do whatever you want without you needing to lifting a finger. Ask, "how does Python already solve my problem?" and "What Python language feature most resembles my problem?" You will be absolutely astonished at how often it happens that thing you need is already there in some form.

> -- [PJ Eby - Python is not Java](http://dirtsimple.org/2004/12/python-is-not-java.html)

It is possible to become productive with Python very fast - even as an absolute beginner in programming. This has a lot to do with the design of the language. It is optimized for people instead of machines. It als comes with batteries included, which means, that there are a lot of problems solved for you already and you don't have to reinvent the wheel every time you are trying to build something. Due to the maturity and popularity of the language there is also a huge number of useful third party tools and libraries (and many of them are [Free Software](https://www.fsf.org/about/what-is-free-software)). This mix makes working with Python easy and fun. 

With this collection of materials I try to organize what I learned about Python and its vast ecosystem over the years into something that will hopefully be useful for beginning and intermediate Pythonistas (maybe the old hands even see something, they didn't know yet).

## No idea what Python is yet?

If you have no idea about Python yet, I recommend reading the [official Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/). If you rather watch a video, [Jessica McKellar made made a good Introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkx5_MRAV3A)
