May the same happen to you with this toolkit.

## New to programming?

When you want to learn programming, you have to start somewhere and that usually is by learning how to write programs in one specific programming language. Picking one is the first hard thing to do. According to the list of programming languages on Wikipedia there are almost 700 [**notable** programming languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_programming_languages). If you want to narrow that down and google for ["best language learn programming"](http://bfy.tw/4yBG) and you find one article in the first 100 hits that does **not** mention Python, please send me the link - that would be a good find. I also believe that Python is a very good first language to learn, so let's just leave it at that and say you made a good choice (unless you want to write an operating system or similar low level code, but you don't want to do that as a beginner unless you are [Linus Torvalds](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds)).

Although you are learning a [formal language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_language) it is still a real language. It has a vocabulary, grammar, semantics and whatever else fancy terminology the linguists came up with describing this stuff.  And just like a natural language: a programming language does not exist in a vacuum. You could say it has its own virtual country, with a ruler (actually Python had the first [Benevolent Dictator For Life](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_Dictator_for_Life)), [leaders](https://docs.python.org/devguide/coredev.html) - a whole culture (including [humor](https://www.python.org/doc/humor/)). It is also not static, it is constantly changing (hence [Python2](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/) and [Python3](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/)). It has a landscape. It has places where the participants in that culture hang out together. It has its own sets of beliefs, philosophies and even taboos. It has an [established process](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0001/#what-is-a-pep) how the language can be improved. In the case of Python it even has its own [zen](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/). If you like Spain, its landscape and its culture, you might want to learn spanish. Just like with natural languages, the reason why some people want to learn Python and some want to learn Ruby can also have to do with the whole culture around it.

If you know all that, you might not wonder if I tell you that it takes years to become really fluent in a programming language, because it is so much more than just learning the syntax, grammar and semantics.

## Expect a lot of Python

> \[...\] become more demanding of Python. Pretend that Python is a magic wand that will miraculously do whatever you want without you needing to lifting a finger. Ask, "how does Python already solve my problem?" and "What Python language feature most resembles my problem?" You will be absolutely astonished at how often it happens that thing you need is already there in some form.

Although it takes years to master a programming language and all of its idiosyncrasies, it is possible to become productive with Python very fast - even as an absolute beginner in programming. This has a lot to do with the design of the language. It is optimized for people instead of machines. It als comes with batteries included, which means, that there are a lot of problems solved for you already and you don't have to reinvent the wheel every time you are trying to build something. Due to the maturity and popularity of the language there is also a huge number of useful third party tools and libraries (and many of them are [Free Software](https://www.fsf.org/about/what-is-free-software)). 

## No idea what Python is yet?

If you have no idea about Python yet, I recommend reading the [official Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/). If you rather watch a video, [Jessica McKellar gave a good introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkx5_MRAV3A)
