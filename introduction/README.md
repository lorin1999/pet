# Yet another course? Really?

This course is a reaction to the [edX MIT course](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-mitx-6-00-1x-6) which mainly teaches programming with learning some Python as a side effect - I want to teach Python with learning some programming as a side effect. I hope to give you an idea why I think Python is a great language for many applications and for beginning and advanced programmers alike.

# Introspection, Tools and Automation

This is the angle this course will take, because that's how I learned and still am learning about programming in Python.

### Introspection

[![Introspection](https://goo.gl/sq1OkT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Droste_effect)

Python is a very introspective language. It contains a lot of functionality that invites you to explore it. For me this is a great way to learn and especially to learn about ones wrong assumptions about how things work by actually investigating what is really happening. This prevents [magical thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult_programming) without taking the [magic](http://www.outpost9.com/reference/jargon/jargon_46.html) out :).

### Tools

A programming language does not exist in a vacuum. The tooling that develops around it plays a just as important role. Python has an astonishing set of great and mostly free tools. An overview over the tools used in this course can be found [here](README.md#tools-for-exploration).

### Automation

> I have a well-deserved reputation for being something of a gadget freak, and am rarely happier than when spending an entire day programming my computer to perform automatically a task that would otherwise take me a good ten seconds to do by hand.

What I mean ist this: by creating this course I am also creating a whole new set of problems for myself that have to do with this very course. How can I make sure that all the links I am using are working? Are all finished documents included properly in the table of contents? Are all my executable examples working properly? Questions over questions that each one can be dealt with in four different ways (that I know of):
        
* Ignore the problems and accept defeat
* Continuous manual checking for problems
* Use of existing automatic tools
* Creation of custom automatic tools

So as part of the course I will create the tools that will create parts of the material and make sure that the materials are in good shape ... a bit like this:
