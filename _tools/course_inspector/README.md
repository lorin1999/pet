# Course Inspector

In the good self referential tradition of this toolkit this README can serve as an example for [README Driven Development](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2010/08/23/readme-driven-development.html)

These tools check the the course contents. They make sure that structure, links, images, executable examples are in good shape.

## Inspections

- [ ] Find broken links

- [ ] Find orphaned files

- [ ] Execute Python to makes sure they work

- [ ] Execute Jupyter Notebooks to make sure they work

## Specs

**Convention over configuration**

* All *.md, *.ipynb and *.py files are considered part of the toolkit -- except files and folders starting with a dot or an underscore.
* The README.md in the root of the project contains the Table of contents and should reference all lower level README.md files.
