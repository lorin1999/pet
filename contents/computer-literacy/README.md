# Basic computer literacy

Before you learn to program you need some basic knowledge about your computer. I don't mean things like how the CPU communicates with the RAM or stuff like that, I mean basic knowledge about how to use your computer, how to deal with files, how to install software - what you could call [computer literacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_literacy).

This is a skill that is completely independent of what programming language you might want to learn and it is very important to avoid additional frustration, when learning a programming language.

## Know that your computer is really very dumb indeed

The main thing to be very aware of - however obvious this might seem - is that your computer is dumb. It does not interpret what you tell it. It does everything exactly like you tell it. There is no wiggle room. You might be vaguely aware of that just by using a computer in the "normal" way, but when you are starting to write programs, you will become **very** aware of it. Just to get an idea, how aware you should become of it: read the chapter about [lexical analysis](https://docs.python.org/3.5/reference/lexical_analysis.html) in the Python docs. Yes, I know it's dry, but please read it. It will raise your awareness.

### Quick aside: invisible things matter

Every character you type into your programs or on the commandline matters. Even invisible character matter. The most important invisible characters are whitespace and line breaks. If you want to learn programming, you have to start understanding their meaning

If you don't know the difference between a `tab` and a `space` yet: now is the time to learn about it. That is one reason why you should use a decent editor or IDE to write your code. Pressing the `tab` key inside a good editor that knows about Python should produce four spaces instead of a real tab for example. This should also work if you have several lines marked. It should move the whole block to the right instead of deleting everything you have written and add a tab character like M$ Notepad is doing it. Notepad is **the exact opposite** of a decent editor. It also should work the same the other way around: pressing `shift+tab` should move the line or block four spaces to the left. This is called indenting and outdenting and is one really central activity in all programming tasks (not only in Python).
    
## Know your filesystem

## Know about filenames

... and learn a bit more about constraints in module filenames

## Know about installing/uninstalling software

## Know your commandline (at least a bit)
