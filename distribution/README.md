# Distributing your work

This is a huge topic, but I will try to keep it simple.

# Simple scripts

* no dependencies - only python with stdlib

-> copy script somewhere and call it with the right python

# Less simple scripts

* third party dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt


# "Proper" Applications and Libraries

* copy packages around that where build with setup.py (e.g. tar.gz, zip. whl)
* devpi (local or hosted)
* Pypi
